# APITestTool README

## Purpose
APITestTool is a web application designed for testing RESTful APIs. It's built to run locally and provides a user-friendly interface to send various types of HTTP requests, facilitating the testing and debugging of API endpoints.

## Technologies
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **Tailwindcss**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Supports
The tool supports the following HTTP methods, allowing for comprehensive testing of RESTful APIs:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from a specified resource.
- **POST**: Send data to a server to create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Update existing resources.
- **DELETE**: Remove specified resources.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload with edits, and lint errors are displayed in the console.

### `npm test`
This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. More information can be found in the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. After building, your app is ready to be deployed. See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more details.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them. At this point, you are on your own. You don’t have to use `eject`, but it’s available if you need it.

## Note
This tool is ideal for small to midsize project deployments. While the `eject` feature offers customization, it's important to consider the implications of such an operation, as it cannot be reversed.
